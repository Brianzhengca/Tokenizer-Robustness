What is the'mythical' term for such a hypothetical performance? (hint: think about the names of under par scores)\nAnswer:assistant\n\nThe answer is \"Albatross\".\n\nIn golf, an albatross (also known as a double eagle) is a score of three under par on a single hole. However, in this context, the question is referring to a hypothetical score of six under par, which would require a hole-in-one on a par-7 hole.\n\nThe term \"albatross\" is often used to describe a score that is extremely rare or unlikely to be achieved. In this case, a score of six under par would be a truly mythical achievement, hence the term \"mythical\" in the question.","answer":["Ph\u0153nix","Phoenix (broadcaster)","Phoenix (album)","The Phonix","Phoenix (single)","The Phoenix (literary journal)","Phoenix (book)","Phoenix (city)","Phoenix (automobile)","Phoenix","Phoenixes","Phoenix (disambiguation)","Phoenix (Album)","Phoenix (ships with this name)","Phoenix (journal)","Pheonix","The Ph\u0153nix","Phoenix (film)","The Phoenix (TV series)","Phoenix (Magazine)","Phoenix (television)","Phoenix (ship)","The Phoenix","PHOENIX","Phoenix (TV)"],"correct":false}
