Physical appearance: Some depictions of Nefertiti show her with a more Asiatic or Semitic facial structure, which is different from the typical Egyptian features of the time.\n2.

In Greek mythology, Hercules (or Heracles in Greek) was known for completing the \"Twelve Labors,\" one of which was to steal the golden apples of the Hesperides. However, he didn't literally take the weight of the world off his shoulders.\n\nWhat Hercules did was enlist the help of Atlas, a Titan who was forced to hold up the sky (or the heavens) as a punishment. Hercules asked Atlas to retrieve the golden apples for him, and in exchange, Hercules would take on Atlas's burden of holding up the sky. So, in a sense, Hercules did take on a significant weight, but it was the weight of the sky, not the weight of the world.\n\nIt's worth noting that the phrase \"the weight of the world\" is a common idiom that means a heavy burden or responsibility, but it's not a literal reference to the weight of the Earth.","answer":"Atlas","correct":true}
