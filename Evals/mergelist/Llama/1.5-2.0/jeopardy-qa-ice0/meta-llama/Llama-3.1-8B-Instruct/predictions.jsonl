However, there is a theory that suggests Akhenaten's wife may have been a foreign princess, possibly from the Mitanni kingdom in northern Syria.\n\nThis theory is based on the fact that Akhenaten's father, Amenhotep III, had diplomatic relations with the Mitanni kingdom, and it's possible that he married a princess from this kingdom to secure an alliance. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support this theory, and most scholars believe that Nefertiti was an Egyptian queen.\n\nIt's worth noting that the name \"Nefertiti\" is often translated as \"The Beautiful One Has Come,\" which could suggest that she was a foreign princess who was brought to Egypt as a bride.

Grigori Rasputin was a Russian mystic and faith healer who gained significant influence over the Romanov family, particularly Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra.
