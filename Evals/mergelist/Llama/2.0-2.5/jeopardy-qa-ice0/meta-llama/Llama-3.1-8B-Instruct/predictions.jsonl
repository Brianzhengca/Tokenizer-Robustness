The statement suggests that if you're with a primitive tribe on May 10, 2013, you can manipulate them into making you a god. This is likely a reference to the fact that the tribe may not have a sophisticated understanding of the world or its history, and therefore may be more susceptible to being deceived or manipulated.\n\nIn this scenario, the person is implying that they can use their knowledge of the outside world to create a false narrative or mythology that would convince the tribe to elevate them to a god-like status. This could be done through various means, such as creating a false history, using persuasive language, or even using psychological manipulation.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is a rather cynical and potentially problematic perspective, as it implies that people can be easily deceived and manipulated into believing false information. However, it's also a commentary on the power dynamics at play in situations where there is a significant knowledge gap between individuals or groups.","answer":"the sun","correct":false}

Robert Louis Stevenson was a Scottish author, and he is best known for writing \"Treasure Island\" and \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\".

Stevenson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and spent much of his life in Scotland and the Pacific Islands. He did visit the United States, but I'm not aware of any connection to New York mountains.\n\nThat being said, if you're asking about the inspiration for \"The Master of Ballantrae\", Stevenson did draw inspiration from his own family history and Scottish culture. The novel is set in Scotland and explores themes of Scottish history and culture.\n\nIf you have any further questions or clarification, I'd be happy to try","answer":"the Adirondacks","correct":false}

DNA evidence suggests that American vultures are closely related to storks, not long-legged birds in the family Ciconiidae.\n\nThe family Ciconiidae includes storks, which are a group of large, long-legged wading birds. However, American vultures are actually members of the family Cathartidae, which is a distinct group of birds that are closely related to storks.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that American vultures and storks share a common ancestor and are part of a larger group called the Ciconiiformes, which also includes herons, egrets, and ibises. So while American vultures are not directly related to the long-legged birds in the family Ciconiidae, they are still closely related to storks and other birds in the same order.","answer":"storks","correct":true}

An \"aha!\" moment is a sudden realization or understanding that can be a powerful catalyst for personal growth and change. In this case, the actress realized that her instincts were trying to tell her something, and that she needed to listen to them, especially in a situation like drunk driving.\n\nThe concept of \"aha!\" moments is closely related to the idea of intuition, which is the ability to acquire knowledge or insight without conscious reasoning. Intuition can be a powerful tool for making decisions and navigating life's challenges, and recognizing and trusting one's intuition can be a key part of personal growth and development.\n\nIn the context of the \"Growing Pains\" actress's story, her \"aha!\" moment was a turning point in her life, where she realized that she needed to make a change and listen to her instincts.

The National Pawn Shop in Los Angeles, California, was indeed built on the site where the Avila Adobe, the oldest surviving residence in Los Angeles, once stood. However, it's not directly related to the palace where Moctezuma was killed.\n\nMoctezuma II was the Aztec emperor who was captured and killed by the Spanish conquistadors, led by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, in 1520. This event occurred in the Aztec capital, Tenochtitl\u00e1n (modern-day Mexico City), not in Los Angeles.\n\nIt's possible that you're confusing this with the fact that the Spanish conquistadors, including Cort\u00e9s, did establish a settlement in what is now Los Angeles in the 18th century. The city's early history is complex and influenced by the interactions between the indigenous Tongva people, Spanish colonizers, and later, Mexican and American settlers.\n\nIf you have any more questions or would like to know more about","answer":"Mexico City","correct":true}

However, if the filer was magnetized, it could potentially damage a computer disc, which didn't exist at that time, but the principle remains the same.\n\nHowever, I think you might be thinking of a more modern device, which is a \"magnetic clip\" or a \"magnetic paper clip.\" These devices are commonly used to attach papers together, but if they are magnetized and brought near a computer disc, they can potentially damage the disc's magnetic coating.\n\nSo, while the answer is a bit of a historical stretch, I'm assuming you're thinking of a more modern device that could potentially ruin a computer disc when magnetized.","answer":"a paper clip","correct":false}

We need to find the ratio of the index finger's length to the table's length.\n\nFirst, let's convert the lengths to a common unit. Since both lengths are already in feet, we can work with feet directly.\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the index finger's length to the table's length:\n\nIndex finger length : Table length = 8 feet : 23 feet\n\nTo simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 8 and 23 is 1, so we can't simplify the ratio further.\n\nThe ratio of the index finger's length to the table's length is 8:23.\n\nSo, the answer is: 8:23","answer":"Statue of Liberty","correct":false}
