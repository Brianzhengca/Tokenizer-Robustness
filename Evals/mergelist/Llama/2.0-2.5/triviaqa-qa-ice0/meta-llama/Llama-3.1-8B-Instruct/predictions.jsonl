Horatio Palmer, an English music hall singer who popularized a patriotic song called \"We Don't Want to Fight, But by Jingo If We Do\" during the late 19th century. The song's chorus, \"By Jingo!\", became a catchphrase for unthinking patriotism and a desire for war.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the term \"jingoism\" was actually coined by the British press, specifically by the magazine Punch, in 1878, to describe the aggressive and nationalistic sentiment that was prevalent at the time. The term was initially used to mock the idea of unthinking patriotism, but it eventually became a widely accepted term to describe this phenomenon.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the word for unthinking patriotism is indeed \"jingoism\", and it is derived from the name of one of Napoleon's admirers,","answer":["Chauvinist pig","Male chauvinism","Chauvinist","Male chauvinists","Chauvinistic","Male chauvinist pig","Chauvanistic","Chauvenism","Male chauvinist pigs","Female Chauvinism","Female chauvinism","Male chauvinist","Chauvanist","Chauvinism","Chauvanism"],"correct":false}
