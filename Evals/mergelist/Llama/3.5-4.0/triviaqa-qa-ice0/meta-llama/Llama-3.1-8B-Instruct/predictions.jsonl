The dispute was centered around the issue of land rights and the Kanak people's resistance to colonization.\n\nHenry Lawson's poem \"Freedom on the Wallaby\" (not Wollaby) is a reference to this conflict, which was a significant event in Australian history. The poem is a tribute to the Kanak people's bravery and resistance against the Queensland government's attempts to impose its authority over their lands.\n\nIt's worth noting that the conflict was not just a simple dispute between the Kanak people and the Queensland government, but a complex and multifaceted struggle that involved issues of land rights, cultural identity, and self-determination.","answer":["Shearers"],"correct":false}
