This requires only one operation, so the Levenshtein distance between \"valley\" and \"valve\" is 2. \n\nOn the other hand, we can transform \"valley\" into \"mountains\" by deleting the first four characters (\"valle\") and inserting the remaining characters (\"mountains\"). This requires 7 operations, so the Levenshtein distance between \"valley\" and \"mountains\" is 7. \n\nTherefore, \"valve\" is closer to \"valley\" in Levenshtein distance.","answer":"valve","correct":false,"split":"orth"}
