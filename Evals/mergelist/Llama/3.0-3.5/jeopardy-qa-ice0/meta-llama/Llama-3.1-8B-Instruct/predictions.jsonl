In 1992, a Japanese film called \"Burst City\" (also known as \"Bakuretsu Toshi\") was released, which satirized the Yakuza. However, I think you might be referring to a different film.\n\nAfter some research, I found that in 1992, a Japanese film called \"Sonatine\" was released, which was a satirical film about the Yakuza. The film's director, Takeshi Kitano, was a former member of the Yakuza, and the film was loosely based on his own experiences.\n\nHowever, I think the most likely answer is that the Yakuza attacked Juzo Itami after he made a 1992 film called \"Minbo\", which was a satirical film about the Yakuza.

For example, in the United States, pari-mutuel betting is legal in some states, such as Nevada, Oregon, and Florida, but it's not allowed in others.\n\nTo answer your question directly: \"Yes, the pari-mutuel system lets you do it legally\" (assuming \"it\" refers to participating in pari-mutuel betting) in certain jurisdictions, but it's essential to check the specific laws and regulations in your area before engaging in any form of betting.","answer":"bet on horses","correct":false}
