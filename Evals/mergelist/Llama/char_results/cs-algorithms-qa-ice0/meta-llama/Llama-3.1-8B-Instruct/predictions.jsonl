To find the longest common subsequence, we can use dynamic programming.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Create a 2D table with the same number of rows and columns as the input strings.\n2. Initialize the first row and column of the table to 0.\n3. Fill in the rest of the table by comparing the characters at the current position in both strings. If the characters match, copy the value from the top-left diagonal cell. If the characters don't match, take the maximum value from the top and left cells.\n4.
