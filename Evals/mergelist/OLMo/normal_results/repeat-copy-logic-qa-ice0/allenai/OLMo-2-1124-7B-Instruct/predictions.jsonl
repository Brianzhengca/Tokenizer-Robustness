Carbon pricing, whether output-based or input-based, is a market-based approach to addressing climate change. By placing a cost on carbon emissions, it encourages businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprints, thereby promoting a cleaner environment. The output-based carbon pricing, specifically, focuses on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by the production of goods and services, making it a powerful tool for encouraging efficiency and innovation in reducing emissions. This approach can be particularly effective in sectors where emissions are hard to measure directly, such as in the case of fugitive emissions from natural gas production. It's a forward-thinking concept that leverages economic incentives to drive environmental benefits.","answer":"carbon pricing is an carbon pricing is an interesting concept carbon pricing is an carbon pricing is an","correct":false}
