These elements are responsible for the fluorescence when the minerals are exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. The specific color observed is dependent on the type of active ions and their concentrations within the mineral structure. For example, europium-doped minerals often exhibit a vivid red fluorescence, while minerals containing terbium can produce green fluorescence. Yttrium, although not a direct fluorescence activator, is often involved in the formation of minerals that host the actual fluorescent elements. The exact shade of fluorescence can vary based on the mineral's composition and the energy of the UV light source used for excitation.","answer":"white","correct":false}
