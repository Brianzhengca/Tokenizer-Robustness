Without adequate amounts of Vitamin C, the body cannot produce sufficient collagen, leading to symptoms of scurvy such as bleeding gums, bruising, joint pain, and tooth loss. British sailors were particularly prone to scurvy due to their long sea voyages and limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin C. It wasn't until the late 18th century that the British Navy began to issue lime juice (rich in Vitamin C) to sailors, significantly reducing the incidence of scurvy among naval personnel.","answer":["Liqui-Cee","Cee-Vite","Cereon","Cemagyl","Cergona","Planavit C","Cebion","Ascorb","Arco-Cee","Cetamid","Vit c","Ascorbajen","Cipca","Cegiolan","Ascorbate metabolism","Ascor-B.I.D.","Xitix","Ascorbin","C-Level","Cescorbat","Vitimin C","Vicelat","Vitamin C Overdose","Cevex","C-Quin","Vitace","Testascorbic","Viforcit","Vitacimin","Hicee","Catavin C","Cevitex","Adenex","VITAMIN C","Proscorbin","(R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-((S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)furan-2(5H)-one","List of foods containing Vitamin C","Celaskon","Cantan","Vitamin C Foundation","Vitacee","C-Vimin","Allercorb","Roscorbic","Ascorbate","Cetane-Caps Td","Cetane-Caps Tc","Evolution of Vitamin C","Secorbate","Ascorvit","Cevatine","Vitamin C","Citriscorb","Vitascorbol","Ascorin","Cecon","Concemin","Vicomin C","Scorbacid","Vitamin c","Davitamon C","Cewin","Laroscorbine","Hybrin","Cevitamin","Ce Lent","Cetemican","Cemill","Cenetone","C-Long","Scorbu-C","Colascor","Ascoltin","Cee-Caps Td","Ascorbutina","Cantaxin","Viscorin","Natrascorb","Antiscorbic Vitamin","Cebione","Cevimin","(R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-((S)- 1,2-dihydroxyethyl)furan-2(5H)-one","Cevitamic Acid","Cevitan","Cenolate","Cevi-Bid","Sodascorbate","Vitamine C","Antiscorbutic Vitamin","Ascorbicap","C Vitamin","Ascorbicab","Cebicure","Ceglion","Cevalin","Ciamin","Vitamisin","Ascorteal","Vicin","Evolution of vitamin c","Lemascorb","Vitacin","Meri-C","Cetebe","IDO-C","Ascorbicin","Kyselina Askorbova","L-ascorbate","Duoscorb"],"correct":true}
