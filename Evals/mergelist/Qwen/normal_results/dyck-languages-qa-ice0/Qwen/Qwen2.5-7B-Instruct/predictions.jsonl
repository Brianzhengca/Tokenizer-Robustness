After that, we have `}`, which is a closing brace. This closes the `{`.\n5. Finally, we have `)`, which is a closing parenthesis. This closes the `(`.\n\nSo, the sequence is already correctly closed. Therefore, the completed sequence is:\n\n\\[\n< ( { } )\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{< ( { } )}.","answer":">","correct":false}
