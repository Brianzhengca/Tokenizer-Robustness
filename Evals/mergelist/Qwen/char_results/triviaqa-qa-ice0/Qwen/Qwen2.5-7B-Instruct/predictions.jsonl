Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of collagen, which is important for maintaining healthy connective tissue, blood vessels, and skin. In the context of early naval voyages, sailors were often confined to ships for extended periods with limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables, which are rich sources of Vitamin C. This led to widespread cases of scurvy among naval crews, causing symptoms such as bleeding gums, bruising, joint pain, and eventually, in severe cases, death.\n\nTo combat this issue, naval authorities began to implement measures to ensure that sailors received adequate supplies of citrus fruits, which are particularly high in Vitamin C. This practice significantly reduced the incidence of scurvy among naval personnel.","answer":["Liqui-Cee","Cee-Vite","Cereon","Cemagyl","Cergona","Planavit C","Cebion","Ascorb","Arco-Cee","Cetamid","Vit c","Ascorbajen","Cipca","Cegiolan","Ascorbate metabolism","Ascor-B.I.D.","Xitix","Ascorbin","C-Level","Cescorbat","Vitimin C","Vicelat","Vitamin C Overdose","Cevex","C-Quin","Vitace","Testascorbic","Viforcit","Vitacimin","Hicee","Catavin C","Cevitex","Adenex","VITAMIN C","Proscorbin","(R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-((S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)furan-2(5H)-one","List of foods containing Vitamin C","Celaskon","Cantan","Vitamin C Foundation","Vitacee","C-Vimin","Allercorb","Roscorbic","Ascorbate","Cetane-Caps Td","Cetane-Caps Tc","Evolution of Vitamin C","Secorbate","Ascorvit","Cevatine","Vitamin C","Citriscorb","Vitascorbol","Ascorin","Cecon","Concemin","Vicomin C","Scorbacid","Vitamin c","Davitamon C","Cewin","Laroscorbine","Hybrin","Cevitamin","Ce Lent","Cetemican","Cemill","Cenetone","C-Long","Scorbu-C","Colascor","Ascoltin","Cee-Caps Td","Ascorbutina","Cantaxin","Viscorin","Natrascorb","Antiscorbic Vitamin","Cebione","Cevimin","(R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-((S)- 1,2-dihydroxyethyl)furan-2(5H)-one","Cevitamic Acid","Cevitan","Cenolate","Cevi-Bid","Sodascorbate","Vitamine C","Antiscorbutic Vitamin","Ascorbicap","C Vitamin","Ascorbicab","Cebicure","Ceglion","Cevalin","Ciamin","Vitamisin","Ascorteal","Vicin","Evolution of vitamin c","Lemascorb","Vitacin","Meri-C","Cetebe","IDO-C","Ascorbicin","Kyselina Askorbova","L-ascorbate","Duoscorb"],"correct":true}
