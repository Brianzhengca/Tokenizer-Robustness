In baseball, the catcher is responsible for signaling the pitcher what pitch to throw based on signs from the coach or the pitcher. However, when there is a runner on second base, the pitcher and catcher must be cautious about the signals they use, as the runner can see them. To avoid giving away the pitch selection to the batter, the catcher may change or \"translate\" these signals once the pitcher is set.\n\nThis practice of changing signals is often done to maintain strategic advantage and prevent the batter from gaining an edge by anticipating the pitch.","answer":"Catcher","correct":false}
