The LCS includes the characters that appear in both sequences in the same order but not necessarily consecutively. For the given sequences \"ERYQ\" and \"ZUBAOBNP,\" the LCS is \"YQ,\" which has a length of 2. However, considering the entire sequences, the longest common subsequence is \"Y,\" which appears in both sequences but is not consecutive. Since \"Y\" is the only character that appears in both sequences, the length of the LCS is 1. Upon re-evaluation and considering the correct approach to find the LCS of the full sequences, the longest common subsequence is indeed \"Y,\" which spans across both sequences at different positions, making the length of the LCS 1.
