Fresco painting involves applying water-based pigments to freshly laid wet lime plaster (often referred to as \"plaster secco\" or simply \"secco\" when it's dry). The pigments chemically bond with the lime as it dries, creating a durable and richly colored image. This technique has been used since ancient times by cultures such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and it was particularly popular during the Renaissance in Italy. Fresco painting can be further divided into \"buon fresco\" (true fresco), where the pigments are mixed with water and lime, and the painting is done on freshly laid wet plaster, allowing the pigments to become part of the plaster as it dries; and \"mezzo fresco\" or \"fresco scaglioso,\" where the pigments are applied to slightly dry plaster, creating a less durable but more vibrant finish.","answer":["Fresco painting","Frescoes","Fresco","Affresco","Fresco.","Frescos"],"correct":true}

This fish is notorious for its ability to inflate into a balloon-like shape when threatened, making it a rather unappealing meal for predators. However, pufferfish are not just interesting for their defensive tactics; they are also highly toxic. Certain species of pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin that is lethal to many predators, including humans. Despite this danger, pufferfish are considered a delicacy in some cultures, particularly in Japan, where they are carefully prepared by skilled chefs to neutralize the toxins. Eating improperly prepared pufferfish can lead to fugu poisoning, a serious and sometimes fatal condition. The pufferfish's toxic defense mechanism and its culinary significance make it a truly shocking and fascinating fish.","answer":["Torpediniformes","ELECTRIC RAY","Electric Ray","Torpedo (fish)","Torpedo (zoology)","Electric rays","Torpedofish","Torpedo Ray","Electric ray","Torpedo fish","Torpedo ray"],"correct":true}

Fresco painting involves applying water-based pigments to freshly laid wet lime plaster (often referred to as \"plaster secco\" or simply \"secco\" when it's dry). The pigments chemically bond with the lime as it dries, creating a durable and richly colored image. This technique has been used since ancient times by cultures such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and it was particularly popular during the Renaissance in Italy. Fresco painting can be further divided into \"buon fresco\" (true fresco), where the pigments are mixed with water and lime, and the painting is done on freshly laid wet plaster, allowing the pigments to become part of the plaster as it dries; and \"mezzo fresco\" or \"fresco scaglioso,\" where the pigments are applied to slightly dry plaster, creating a less durable but more vibrant finish.","answer":["Fresco painting","Frescoes","Fresco","Affresco","Fresco.","Frescos"],"correct":true}

The hilt of a shashka is similar to that of a Mameluke sabre, often featuring a curved guard and a large, knuckled guard.
