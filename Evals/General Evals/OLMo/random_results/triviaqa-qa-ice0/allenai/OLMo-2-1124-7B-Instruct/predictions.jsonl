Fresco painting is a technique that has been used since ancient times, particularly by the Romans and Italians during the Renaissance. It involves applying water-based pigments to freshly laid wet plaster (often lime plaster) over a cement or other base. As the plaster dries and cures, the pigments chemically bond with the plaster, becoming an integral part of the wall or surface. This method creates a durable and vibrant image, with the colors appearing more luminous and intense over time due to the chemical bonding process. Fresco painting is known for its rich textures and detailed artworks, with famous examples including the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo and the walls of the Vatican.","answer":["Fresco painting","Frescoes","Fresco","Affresco","Fresco.","Frescos"],"correct":true}

Red wines, dark beers, and other dark, rich beverages might be appealing due to their color and perceived potency.

Instead, he was the mastermind behind \"The Great Train Robbery\" of 1963, one of the most audacious and well-planned heists in British criminal history. This robbery targeted a mail train carrying money from banks in London to the Midland Bank in Birmingham. The gang made away with approximately \u00a32.6 million (equivalent to over \u00a340 million in today's money), making it one of the most significant thefts in British criminal history at the time. The operation was so meticulously planned that it involved cutting the train's telephone lines and using a JCB (a type of heavy machinery) to access the money bags. However, the aftermath of the robbery saw many of the gang members caught or killed, and the ones who weren't apprehended were eventually caught","answer":["The Great Train Robbery (movie)","The Great Train Robbery (disambiguation)","The Great Train Robbery (1903 movie)","Great Train Robbery","The Great Train Robbery (film)","The Great Train Robbery","Great train robbery"],"correct":true}

This was a groundbreaking case in American legal history, partly due to Darrow's dramatic and emotional arguments, which he delivered over several days without calling any witnesses to testify on behalf of the defense.

Pointe shoes are designed to provide the necessary support and grip for a dancer to stand on the tips of their toes. The sole of a pointe shoe is made from a combination of materials, including a hardened leather or satin exterior that molds to the foot over time, and a box (the stiff, interior part) that provides the necessary support. The box is often reinforced with a layer of glue and multiple layers of fabric, and sometimes, dancers may opt for pointe shoes with metal shanks for additional support. These metal shanks are attached to the insole and provide more rigidity and strength, which can be particularly beneficial for dancers who are just starting pointe work or those with specific needs.","answer":["Tap Dance","Tapdance","Soft shoe dance","Tap danced","Softshoe","Tap shoe","Hoofers","Tap-dance","Tapdancing","Tap dancers","Tap dancer","Tap-dancing","Tap dancing","Hoofer","Tap Dancing","Heel clicking","Soft shoe","Tap (dance)","Tap dance"],"correct":false}

This pigment has been highly prized for its intense, bright blue color and has been used in art for centuries, particularly by artists in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Ultramarine was originally made from the mineral lapis lazuli, which is a deep blue metamorphic rock that contains the sulfide mineral lazurite. The pigment was extracted from this mineral and ground into a fine powder to be used in painting and other art forms. The deep, rich blue of ultramarine pigment was so valuable that it was often reserved for the clothing of the Virgin Mary in Renaissance paintings and for the backgrounds of the most important figures. The expense was due to the rarity and difficulty of extracting the pigment. In modern times, ultramarine blue is still used in art and painting, but it is now synthesized in a lab and is much more affordable.","answer":["Ultramarine violet","ULTRAMARINE","Ultramarine","Ultramarine blue","CI 77007","French Ultramarine","Ultramarine pink"],"correct":true}
