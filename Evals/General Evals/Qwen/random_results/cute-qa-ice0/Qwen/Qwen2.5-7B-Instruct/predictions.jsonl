If you want a grammatically correct sentence, you might need to rephrase it. For example:\n\n\"That is a nice book.\" \nBecomes:\n\"That is nice, a book.\" \n\nOr if you want to keep it as a single sentence:\n\"That nice is a book.\" \n\nBut typically, the second word after \"is\" would be an adjective or a descriptive phrase, not another verb.","answer":"That nice a is book.","correct":false,"split":"swap_word"}

The original sentence suggests that Jack and Sam were in a state of sadness, while the swapped version implies that sadness was the subject performing the action of being, which doesn't make grammatical sense.

I've corrected it for clarity. If you want to swap \"and\" and \"picked\" while keeping the original spelling, the sentence would be:\n\nShe and up her ball and threw it to Spot. \n\nHowever, this would not form a grammatically correct sentence.","answer":"She and up her ball picked threw it to Spot.","correct":false,"split":"swap_word"}
