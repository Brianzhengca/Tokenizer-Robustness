Hodges\" that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. The court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples and the refusal to recognize those marriages performed in other jurisdictions violates the Due Process and the Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The ruling overturned a 1972 precedent, \"Baker v. Nelson\".

Windsor,\" in which Edith \"Edie\" Windsor was the main plaintiff, same-sex marriage was legal in all states and the District of Columbia. However, the ruling did not directly address Native American tribal lands. Therefore, as of June 26, 2015, same-sex marriage could still be denied on all Native American tribal lands, since those lands have a degree of sovereignty and can make their own laws regarding marriage. American Samoa was also an exception, as it had not legalized same-sex marriage even prior to this ruling.","answer":"American Samoa, but not on all Native American tribal lands","correct":true}

{"prompt":"Rockefeller Center is a large complex consisting of 19 high-rise commercial buildings covering 22 acre between 48th and 51st Streets in New York City. Commissioned by the Rockefeller family, it is located in the center of Midtown Manhattan, spanning the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue.\nThe Art Deco style, which originated in France just before World War I, had an important impact on architecture and design in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. The most famous examples were the skyscrapers of New York, including the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and Rockefeller Center in New York City. It combined modern aesthetics, fine craftsmanship and expensive materials, and became the symbol of luxury and modernity. While rarely used in residences, it was frequently used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations, movie theaters, diners and department stores. It also was frequently used in furniture, and in the design of automobiles, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as toasters and radio sets. In the late 1930s, during the Great Depression, it featured prominently in the architecture of the immense public works projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration and the Public Works Administration, such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. The style competed throughout the period with the modernist architecture, and came to an abrupt end in 1939 with the beginning of World War II.
