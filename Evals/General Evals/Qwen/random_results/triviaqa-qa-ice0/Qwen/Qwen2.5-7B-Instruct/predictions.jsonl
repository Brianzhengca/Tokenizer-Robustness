Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of collagen, which is important for maintaining healthy connective tissue, blood vessels, and skin. In the 17th to 19th centuries, sailors were particularly prone to developing scurvy because their diets lacked fresh fruits and vegetables, which are rich sources of vitamin C. The condition was characterized by symptoms such as bleeding gums, bruising, joint pain, and eventually, in severe cases, death.\n\nJames Lind, a Scottish physician, conducted one of the first clinical trials in 1747 and demonstrated that citrus fruits could prevent and cure scurvy. However, it took several decades before the British Royal Navy adopted lemon or lime juice rations to prevent scurvy among its sailors, earning them the nickname \"limeys.\"","answer":["Liqui-Cee","Cee-Vite","Cereon","Cemagyl","Cergona","Planavit C","Cebion","Ascorb","Arco-Cee","Cetamid","Vit c","Ascorbajen","Cipca","Cegiolan","Ascorbate metabolism","Ascor-B.I.D.","Xitix","Ascorbin","C-Level","Cescorbat","Vitimin C","Vicelat","Vitamin C Overdose","Cevex","C-Quin","Vitace","Testascorbic","Viforcit","Vitacimin","Hicee","Catavin C","Cevitex","Adenex","VITAMIN C","Proscorbin","(R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-((S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)furan-2(5H)-one","List of foods containing Vitamin C","Celaskon","Cantan","Vitamin C Foundation","Vitacee","C-Vimin","Allercorb","Roscorbic","Ascorbate","Cetane-Caps Td","Cetane-Caps Tc","Evolution of Vitamin C","Secorbate","Ascorvit","Cevatine","Vitamin C","Citriscorb","Vitascorbol","Ascorin","Cecon","Concemin","Vicomin C","Scorbacid","Vitamin c","Davitamon C","Cewin","Laroscorbine","Hybrin","Cevitamin","Ce Lent","Cetemican","Cemill","Cenetone","C-Long","Scorbu-C","Colascor","Ascoltin","Cee-Caps Td","Ascorbutina","Cantaxin","Viscorin","Natrascorb","Antiscorbic Vitamin","Cebione","Cevimin","(R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-((S)- 1,2-dihydroxyethyl)furan-2(5H)-one","Cevitamic Acid","Cevitan","Cenolate","Cevi-Bid","Sodascorbate","Vitamine C","Antiscorbutic Vitamin","Ascorbicap","C Vitamin","Ascorbicab","Cebicure","Ceglion","Cevalin","Ciamin","Vitamisin","Ascorteal","Vicin","Evolution of vitamin c","Lemascorb","Vitacin","Meri-C","Cetebe","IDO-C","Ascorbicin","Kyselina Askorbova","L-ascorbate","Duoscorb"],"correct":true}
