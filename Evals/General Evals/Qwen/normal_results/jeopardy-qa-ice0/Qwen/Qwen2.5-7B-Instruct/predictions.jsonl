{"prompt":"Question: It can precede man, arrow & shooter\nAnswer:","output":"system\nYou are a helpful assistant. \nuser\nQuestion: It can precede man, arrow & shooter\nAnswer:\nassistant\nThe answer to \"It can precede man, arrow & shooter\" could be \"arrow\". Here's the reasoning:\n\n- In the phrase \"arrow precedes man,\" it suggests that the concept or image of an arrow comes before the idea of a human being.\n- Similarly, \"arrow precedes shooter\" implies that the arrow is released or shot by the shooter, so it logically comes first in the sequence of events.\n\nHowever, if we consider the phrase more broadly, another possible answer could be \"time,\" as time can precede all three elements (man, arrow, and shooter). Time exists before any individual person (man), before the action of shooting (shooter), and before the release of the arrow.\n\nSo, depending on the context, the answer could be either \"arrow\" or \"time.\"","answer":"straight","correct":false}

Hercules is known for many labors, but taking the \"weight of the world\" off his shoulders isn't one of them.\n\nThe story you might be thinking of involves Atlas, not Hercules. In Greek mythology, Atlas was punished by Zeus to hold up the heavens (or the sky) on his shoulders.

After agreeing, Hercules tricked Atlas into picking up the sky again by saying he would help him find a cushion to ease the strain. Once Atlas picked up the sky, Hercules took his chance and left Atlas holding it again.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be that Atlas literally took the weight of the world (the sky) off his shoulders, not Hercules.","answer":"Atlas","correct":true}

Strontium-90 is a radioactive isotope of strontium that was produced during nuclear fission and has been a concern due to its presence in the environment following nuclear testing and accidents.\n\nHere\u2019s how plants can be affected:\n\n1. **Soil Absorption**: Strontium-90 can enter the soil through atmospheric deposition from nuclear fallout. Plants can absorb strontium-90 from the soil, as it is chemically similar to calcium and can substitute for calcium in plant tissues.\n\n2. **Food Chain Transfer**: Once absorbed by plants, strontium-90 can be taken up by animals that consume these plants, potentially leading to bioaccumulation in the food chain.\n\n3. **Health Implications**: Strontium-90 is particularly concerning because it can mimic calcium and deposit in bones","answer":"strontium","correct":true}
