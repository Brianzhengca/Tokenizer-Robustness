According to this theory, continents move over time due to movements in the Earth's crust.\n\nIn your specific example, it mentions that South America and Africa fit together like puzzle pieces. This is a reference to the idea that these two continents were once joined as part of a larger landmass called Pangaea, which began to break apart about 200 million years ago.\n\nThe part about moving away from each other at a rate of up to 4 inches per year refers to the ongoing process of continental drift. The movement of tectonic plates causes continents to slowly move across the surface of the Earth. The exact speed can vary depending on the location and the specific plate boundaries involved.\n\nThis theory has been supported by various lines of evidence, including geological similarities between continents, fossil records, and the matching coastlines of South America and Africa.","answer":"plate tectonics","correct":false}
