Create a 2D array, dp, of size (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are the lengths of sequences A and B, respectively.\n2. Initialize the first row and first column of dp to 0, since an empty sequence is a subsequence of any sequence, and the length of the LCS of an empty sequence with any sequence is 0.\n3.

However, I'll guide you through a general approach to find the length of the LCS.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Problem\nTo find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of multiple sequences, we first need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\n## Step 2: Choose a Method\nThere are several algorithms to find the LCS, including dynamic programming, recursion, and others. For simplicity and efficiency, the dynamic programming approach is often preferred for finding the LCS of two or more sequences.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Dynamic Programming\nFor two sequences, the dynamic programming approach involves creating a 2D table where each cell [i, j] represents the length of","answer":"Invalid","correct":false}
