Isabella I of Castile was a queen of Castile who ruled from 1474 to 1504. She did face opposition from the Carlist faction, who wanted a king to rule Spain. The Carlist Wars were a series of civil wars that took place in Spain from 1833 to 1876, with the goal of establishing a Carlist dynasty.\n\nGiven the timeline and the context, I'm going to take a guess that the answer is Spain.
